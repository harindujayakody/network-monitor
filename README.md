## Overview

This Python program serves as a simple yet effective network monitor, providing real-time information about data usage and network speeds. It calculates and displays total upload and download data in megabytes, along with current upload and download speeds in kilobits per second (Kbps) and megabits per second (Mbps), respectively.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitors network usage and updates statistics at a specified interval.
- **Clear Console Display:** Utilizes the `psutil` and `pyfiglet` libraries to present information in a visually appealing and easy-to-read format.
- **User-Friendly:** Offers a clean interface with custom-styled text and a dynamic heading.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install required Python libraries using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil pyfiglet
   ```
3. Run the program by executing the script:
   ```bash
   python network_monitor.py
   ```
